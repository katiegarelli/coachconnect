# Coach Connect Background
Coach Connect is a coaching platform to connect athletes with high quality coaching no matter their geographical location. Users simply create an account, purchase review credits,  upload a video of them competing, and select a coach matching their interests and price range. The coach will be then notified of the upload and review the video by providing both audio and written feedback to the athlete. Our goal is to create a coaching platform that allows athletes of all levels to have access to the best coaching possible.
